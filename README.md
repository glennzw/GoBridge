# GoBridge

GoBridge is an SMTP to GMail API service. It will allow you to host an SMTP server that will accept emails and directly INSERT them into users' inboxes, bypassing any filtering. This is achieved by using the GMail API; and specifically the `users.messages.insert` endpoint.

You will need to create and authorize a service account, save the `service_secret.json` file to the working directory, and delegate domain-wide authority for the service account. This will give permission to impersonate any user and insert the email into their inbox. For a step by step list of instructions please see [GMailSetup.md](GMailSetupDocumentation/GMailSetup.md)


## Package Installation
Run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to install the appropriate packages.

## Configuration
Appropriate settings can be defined in the `config.json` file. The default values are:

```
[GOBRIDGE]
ClientSecretFile = service_secret.json
SMTPPort = 2500
SMTPInterface = localhost
Labels = INBOX,UNREAD,IMPORTANT,STARRED
```

The `Labels` section refer to GMail labels - the default values ensure the email will be as visible as possible to the user.

Make sure the `service_secret.json` file has been [generated](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/service-account#creatinganaccount) and downloaded. 

## Running
Simply run the Python file, for example:

```
$ python3 GoBridge.py

   _____       ____       _     _            
  / ____|     |  _ \     (_)   | |

                                   __/ |     
                                  |___/

As can be seen in the above output email addresses not in the scope of the service account will be rejected.


## Docker build

In order to build docker image, need to run `docker build -t GoBridge .`

## Docker running

To run GoBridge into docker image, need to set up few variables specify into .env.example
- First need to copy .env.exampke into .env file `cp .env.example .env`
- Run `cat service_secret.json|base64` and copy value and set value of GOOGLE_SECRET_BASE64_ENCODED with output value

Now you can run `docker run  -p 2500:2500  -t --env-file=.env  GoBridge`
